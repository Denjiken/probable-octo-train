  <h2>Mt. maruyog farm & Garden</h2>
  <p>
    Mt. Maruyog Farm and Garden Resort in Brgy. Tubtub – located eight kilometers inland from the town center of Brooke’s Point, Palawan – was an oasis of countryside calm, after the dusty bus ride from Quezon where I visited the Tabon Caves Complex. My bamboo bungalow was tucked beneath some cashew trees – that occasionally sent apple-sized cashew fruits crashing down onto the grassy lawn.
